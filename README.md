## Welcome to the Module

Here in this module we'll learn some general principles of sound recording in order to make our own podcasts. The module is broken out into three parts: 

1. Sound and Noise
2. Recording Voice
3. Designing Sounds

In order to complete the module you'll need access to `a laptop or desktop computer equipped with a microphone`. The rest of the activity will use free sound editing softare and audio files.
