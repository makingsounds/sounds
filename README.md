# Module Overview

Here in this module we'll learn some general principles of sound recording in order to make our own podcasts. The module is broken out into three parts: 

1. Sound and Noise
2. Recording Voice
3. Designing Sounds

In order to complete the module you'll need access to `a laptop or desktop computer equipped with a microphone`. The rest of the activity will use free sound editing softare and audio files. 

## Sound and Noise

The human condition is something that we often talk about when we're talking about art. Photographs, imagery, vivid lingual descriptions, these things can make us feel a certain way--happy, sad, mad. What is particularly interesting about sound and the human condition is its ability to put us in a particular "mood." 

Often sound is used as a "background," or "ambiance," or to give "atmosphere." And, within the frame of mood, it seems that this is one of the most powerful uses of sound as it does not tell us how to feel; it gives us cues for what emotions are appropriate in the first place. 

### Selective Attention and the Problem of Noise
Stop and listen to your surroundings for a second. What do you hear? Nothing? Try again. Do you hear an air conditioner? Birds? Other people chattering in the distance? These certainly aren't nothing. But, for some miraculous reason, we don't notice them. We, as humans, have a powerful ability to "tune out" unwanted noise--interference with the main signal we are attempting to receive--depending on the given task we are engaging. This is a well studied concept called "selective attention." To test your ability to selectively give attention, watch this video.

Were you an effective selector? Or did you "miss" something? As it turns out, you didn't really miss anything. Just because you were not necessarily looking for a moonwalking gorrilla doesn't mean that it wasn't part of the bouquet of visual elements in the video. It was (and a fairly prominent one on second glance). But, because humans are exceptional selectors, you just "tuned it out" to focus on a specific goal in the video. We do the same thing with regard to sound when we are in a noisy cafeteria, or standing outside as a plane flies overhead. We can focus on a particular sound and tune out the noise.

In the case of sound recording, microphones are not as good at selecting sounds--they just sort of mindlessly take everything in. If you've ever recorded outside on a gusty day, or while a crowd cheers in the background, you know firsthand that sounds that have nothing to do with what we are attempting to capture can overpower our desired signal. We call this noise. 

With all of this in mind, close your eyes, and listen to this:

Then, close your eyes again and listen to this:

What mood does this put you in? What are the elements that create this mood? Why? Can you imagine difficulties that the sound engineer might have had capturing this sound? What are those? How do you imagine they overcame these difficulties? We're going to be tackling our own answers to these questions as we do the activity. But before that, we'll move to a quick discussion of voice.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/makingsounds/sounds/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
