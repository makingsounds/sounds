# Module Overview

Here in this module we'll learn some general principles of sound recording in order to make our own podcasts. The module is broken out into three parts: 

1. Sound and Noise
2. Recording Voice
3. Putting Sounds Together

    `To complete the module you'll need access to a laptop or desktop computer equipped with a microphone. You will also need to download and install free sound editing softare and audio files [instructions included below].` 

## 1. Sound and Noise

The human condition is something that we often talk about when we're talking about art. Photographs, imagery, vivid lingual descriptions, these things can make us feel a certain way--happy, sad, mad. What is particularly interesting about sound and the human condition is its ability to put us in a particular "mood." 

Often sound is used as a "background," or "ambiance," or to give "atmosphere." And, within the frame of mood, it seems that this is one of the most powerful uses of sound as it does not tell us how to feel; it gives us cues for what emotions are appropriate in the first place. 

### Selective Attention and the Problem of Noise
Stop and listen to your surroundings for a second. What do you hear? Nothing? Try again. Do you hear an air conditioner? Birds? Other people chattering in the distance? These certainly aren't nothing. But, for some miraculous reason, we don't notice them. We, as humans, have a powerful ability to "tune out" unwanted noise--interference with the main signal we are attempting to receive--depending on the given task we are engaging. This is a well studied concept called "selective attention." To test your ability to selectively give attention, watch this video.

Were you an effective selector? Or did you "miss" something? As it turns out, you didn't really miss anything. Just because you were not necessarily looking for a moonwalking gorrilla doesn't mean that it wasn't part of the bouquet of visual elements in the video. It was (and a fairly prominent one on second glance). But, because humans are exceptional selectors, you just "tuned it out" to focus on a specific goal in the video. We do the same thing with regard to sound when we are in a noisy cafeteria, or standing outside as a plane flies overhead. We can focus on a particular sound and tune out the noise.

In the case of sound recording, microphones are not as good at selecting sounds--they just sort of mindlessly take everything in. If you've ever recorded outside on a gusty day, or while a crowd cheers in the background, you know firsthand that sounds that have nothing to do with what we are attempting to capture can overpower our desired signal. We call this noise. 

With all of this in mind, close your eyes, and listen to this:

Then, close your eyes again and listen to this:

What mood does this put you in? What are the elements that create this mood? Why? Can you imagine difficulties that the sound engineer might have had capturing this sound? What are those? How do you imagine they overcame these difficulties? We're going to be tackling our own answers to these questions as we do the activity. But before that, we'll move to a quick discussion of voice. 

## 2. Recording Voice
A sound with particular power is the human voice. But, the  thing that makes the human voice wonderful is the exact thing that can make it frustrating to record--the human voice is dynamic, meaning that it moves up and down in volume, and shifts rapidly in texture. Some people have smooth voices, others have raspy ones. Some people speak quietly, while others boom. No matter how nice someone's voice is, recording voice requires awareness of `sibilance` and `clipping`. Let's talk about these ideas so they can help us improve our voice recordings. 

### Some Vocabulary to Help us Record Voice

1. `Sibilance` is a byproduct of how people form words, and the restuling "pops" and "ess" sounds that come from people breathing into a microphone as they speak. When we are recording, generally speaking, we want to put the voice into the microphone, and keep the breath out. If you are experiencing sibilance in your recordings you can use a "wind screen" just in front of the microphone (some people just put a piece of thin cloth over their microphone. But, if a wind screen is not available, speaking at a very slight angle into the microphone can reduce sibilance.

2. `Clipping` is the result of getting a sound that is too loud for our recording system to process. While this might actually be a desirable result in some music genres, in most cases of voice recording, clipping is unpleasant and introduces distracting noise into the signal. Most recording software interfaces will include a simple volume meter that shades from green to yellow to red, where red indicates clipping. While we want to avoid clipping into the red, we also want to make sure that the sound that we are capturing is fully audible. Best practice is to "test" the sounds you'll be recording and adjust the volume to be "loud enough" without clipping.

Now that we have some basic terminology, let's record some voice! 

### Recording Voice

The first thing we'll need to do is download and install Audacity, a free software tool for "mixing" sounds.
