## Module Overview

Here in this module we'll learn some general principles of sound recording in order to make our own podcasts. The module is broken out into three parts: 

1. Sound and Noise
2. Recording Voice
3. Designing Sounds

In order to complete the module you'll need access to `a laptop or desktop computer equipped with a microphone`. The rest of the activity will use free sound editing softare and audio files. 

### Sound and Noise

The human condition is something that we often talk about when we're talking about art. Photographs, imagery, vivid lingual descriptions, these things can make us feel a certain way--happy, sad, mad. What is particularly interesting about sound and the human condition--especially ambient sound--on the other hand, perhaps because of its direct connection to our nervous systems, is its ability to put us in a particular "mood." 

Often sound is used as a "background," or "ambiance," or to give "atmosphere." And, within the frame of mood, it seems that this is one of the most powerful uses of sound as it does not tell us how to feel; it gives us cues for what emotions are appropriate in the first place. 

### Selective Attention and the Problem of Noise
Stop and listen for a second. What do you hear? Nothing? Try again. Do you hear an air conditioner? Birds? Other people chattering in the distance? These certainly aren't nothing. But, for some miraculous reason, we don't notice them. We, as humans, have a powerful ability to "tune out" unwanted noise--interference with the main signal we are attempting to receive--depending on the given task we are engaging. This is a well studied concept called "selective attention." To test your ability to selectively give attention, watch this video.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/makingsounds/sounds/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
